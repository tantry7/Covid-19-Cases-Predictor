# Covid-19-Cases-Predictor
Covid19 Confirmed cases Predictor using Polynomial Regression

<h2>Prediction of rise in Covid19 cases in India based on the number of confirmed cases</h2>
<p>India is suffering a pandemic with the world, where millions have been affected with a virus named SARS-CoV2. 
It is a virus which has been spreading rapidly and infecting people across the country rapidly. 
The infection is spreading among people at an exponential rate.</p>



<h3><strong>Objective</strong> : Predicting the number of confirmed covid19 cases in India</h3>

<h3>Implementation :  Linear Regression algorithm from sklearn library, PolynomialFeatures to build the Machine Learning model. </h3>

<h3><l>Dataset</l><h3>
  
<p>The dataset consists of covid19 confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths, of all the countries, recorded day-wise, since January 22 2020, to till August 9th, 2020.  (source - kaggle)
  We filter this data Such that we Have Data of Indias Dataset.</p>
